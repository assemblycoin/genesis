# AssemblyCoin Genesis Block Source

This repo contains the source that's used by the `assembled` implementation of the AssemblyCoin Network protocol when bootstrapping a new blockchain.
The source here is a trivial set of inputs that can be independently verified, eliminating the need for a large consensus on the build process. 
This is required when bootstrapping the blockchain because the first block is created when there is only a single node on the network.
